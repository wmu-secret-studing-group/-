## case 1
A 32-year-old woman delivered a large (4800 g) baby vaginally after some difficulty with her labor. Her prenatal course was complicated by diabetes, which occurred during pregnancy. At delivery, the infant’s head emerged, but the shoulders were "stuck" behind the maternal symphysis pubis, requiring the obstetrician to apply some effort and maneuvers to free up the infant’s shoulders and complete the delivery. The infant was noted to have a good cry and pink color but was not moving its right arm.

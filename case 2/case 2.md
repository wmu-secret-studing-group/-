# CASE 2 
A 32-year-old man is involved in a motor vehicle accident. He used three-point restraints and was driving a sedan. The driver of a pick-up truck ran a stop sign while going at approximately 45 mph and “T-boned” the patient’s vehicle on the driver’s side. The patient has multiple injuries including a displaced frac- ture of the left humerus. He complains of an inability to open his left hand and loss of sensation to a portion of his left hand.
